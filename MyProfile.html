      <h1 class="sectionContent"> Technology is something that I have been interested in since a young age, so the decision to study Information Technology in RMIT University came naturally. Technology is constantly emerging over the years and fortunately, I am in the right era to be able to learn and observe how big of an impact it has on the world today. My interest started when I was in high school learning about how cloud services can affect the future work force and even benefit companies that are venturing into technology. That made me want to learn more about the fundamentals behind it. Where technology will potentially be in 20 years’ time intrigues me, and it’s exciting to be in involved in technology because it allows me to point my career in a lot of different directions.      </h1>
        <h1 class="sectionContent">The person who has inspired me the most is my uncle who is the Senior Client Executive/Director at a large IT company. He has never fails to give me advice on what skills and courses are in demand by IT companies which will broaden my opportunities. He also takes time to guide me through career choices and introduce me to people in the industry.</h1>


      <h1 class="sectionContent">I chose to pursue my degree in RMIT because it is a modern university that offers a wide range of practical experiences instead of just theory. RMIT also focuses on work internship that will be beneficial to me when I’m out in the work force. It also places an emphasis on preparing students on emerging trends, which will equip me with the necessary skills for my future.
        </li>
      </h1>

      <h1 class="sectionContent">I expect to learn new skills that will not only be beneficial to me in the working world, but also help me develop as a student in the university. Studying in this course will help me to discover what I’m passionate about and learn how to adapt to changes. It will encourage me to reflect on my best qualities as well as my weaknesses, and to build my self-confidence along the way.

     <p class="sectionContent">The position I choose to pursue in is cloud security. What makes this position appealing to me is how cloud services influence businesses by enhancing security and enabling them to cut back on risks. Cloud computing has many different areas but the one that is most enticing to me is how cloud security can defense a country. Cloud security is a fast expanding service that offers mostly the same process as a typical IT security firm, including preventing data leakage and staying ahead of risks in the cloud environment.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent"> Skills required for this position range from knowing the fundamentals of how cloud security operates to detecting threats in the system. Having an educational background in IT will give me the necessary expertise for this role. Gaining experience and exposure from internship relating to the cloud security industry will also be useful for this position.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent">I am currently a student pursuing a Bachelor’s degree, majoring in IT at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Having previously worked as an admin assistant as well as a desktop support assistant has helped me become more comfortable with working in a team and strengthened my communication skills. With a positive attitude and a good work ethic I believe I can spearhead any enterprise forward.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent">To obtain the required skills for this job, I will be taking online courses on cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and artificial intelligence. Not only will this broaden my knowledge, but it will also give me insights on how the IT industry operates. I will also take up an internship position at an IT firm during my holidays. This is to increase my chances of getting hired by boosting up the employer’s confidence in trusting me with the position. Furthermore, I will expand my network by going to IT related events and meeting people who are working in the sector.</p>

     <p class="sectionContent"> According to the Myers-Briggs test, I am an ISTJ which indicates that I score higher on introversion, sensing, thinking and judging. This means that I learn best and enjoy being in calm surroundings. Being a sensor also means that I possess strong attention to detail. Furthermore, I tend to have logical rationale behind my decisions. And lastly, I will more likely stick to a plan I have created and follow a schedule rather than do tasks spontaneously.<p class="sectionContent">According to an online learning style test, I am a visual learner which means I learn best with visual aids such as diagrams, graphs, or charts. I also tend to gravitate towards learning materials that allow me to see and picture what I am learning, instead of demanding me to read it.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent">According to the Big Five Personality Test, the big five factors are Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Natural reactions. Having scored low in openness to experience shows that I am a traditional person who is down to earth and practical. Scoring average in conscientiousness means that I am in between being flexible and disciplined when it comes to my work ethics. I am also in the 37th percentile in terms of extraversion, meaning that I can be reserved and serious but also friendly and assertive. Having scored extremely low in agreeableness means that I am a competitive person, especially in my work environment. The test also shows that I am not easily upset in stressful situations, according to my natural reactions.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent">The results of these tests has helped me understand myself better as an individual by illustrating my personality in different ways. I will be able to utilize these results as an advantage to control my thinking and steer it in the direction that can help me achieve my goal. The results also showed me how I would learn best, which will allow me to adjust my learning method so that I can absorb information more efficiently.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent">These results will make me more conscious of my actions and how they may affect other people in the team. I will also attempt to soften my personality aspect which do not necessarily do well in a group setting. </p>
     <p class="sectionContent">Although it would be easier to look for group members who are on the same wavelength, it is important for a team to have diversity. Therefore, I would form a team with members who have different personalities and encourage them to bring up unique ideas. Not only that, but having different personalities in a group may also allow for easier problem solving.</p>

     <p class="sectionContent">When faced with two types of trash bins, people are often confused by what type of waste is considered landfill and what is recyclable. The compact description of items belonging to each bin provided in the area is also often limited. This project involves the development of an application that is intended to help users manage their waste. The application will enable users to decide whether their waste is recyclable in a few easy steps. Users can search for their waste on the search bar in the application, which will then tell them whether it will be treated as landfill, or recyclable.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent">Australia is a big recycler, 60% of the total waste produced in 2014 to 2015 were recycled. Therefore, there is a high demand for products that encourage and provide better education on recycling. The government has also emphasized on the importance of correctly sorting garbage before throwing them. This is to avoid further crisis that has been going on with the Australian recycling industry recently, where recyclables ended up in landfill. BinMe is a simple solution for people who want to start recycling.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent">The application will feature a welcome screen showing the name of the application; “BinMe” and its logo, which will be a tree. This interface will be mostly green in colour and is a loading screen before the next one. The next interface will include a search bar in the middle of the screen and “BinMe” on top of it.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent"> After entering the keyword, users will be able to press on either “Go” on the right hand bottom corner of their keyboard or the magnifying glass symbol on the search bar itself. Both the “Go” key and the magnifying glass symbol will bring users to the next page, which will include a list of all matching words. For example, if the user searches for “tissue”, the list will include items such as “tissue paper”, “tissue box” and “wet tissue”. This second page will also feature a back button symbolized by “&lt;--” that will bring users back the search bar page when tapped.
      </p>
     <p class="sectionContent">Users will then select one of the items from the list by tapping on the name of the item. If the chosen item is recyclable, the application will proceed to show a screen with the name of the item on top of the page, followed by the word “Recyclable”, a yellow tick sign and a trash bin with a yellow lid. The chosen colour reflects the yellow recycling bins around Melbourne. 
      </p>
     <p class="sectionContent">On the other hand, if the chosen item is considered to be general waste, the application will show a page with the name of the item on the top, followed by the word “Landfill”, a red cross sign and a trash bin with a red lid. Similarly, this reflects the colour of landfill waste bins in Melbourne.</p>
     <p class="sectionContent"> Both the “Recyclable” and “Landfill” interface will also feature a back (&lt;--) button that will bring users back to the search page.
      In order to have a complete list of items, the application will be equipped with a database system that consists of an extensive list of everyday waste. Although by no means exhaustive, this list will cover most items in our daily waste. This is a significant feature of the application since not having the item they are looking for will most likely result in users throwing their waste in the general waste bin regardless of whether it is recyclable. The application will also feature a database system that stores the information of whether something is recyclable or not. Since this particular database needs to be extremely accurate, there will be a lot of research that needs to be done in this area. </p>
	 <p class="sectionContent"> Software needed to create this application is called Appery.io. It is a mobile application builder that can create apps for both Android and IOS. The application has a built in visual editor with a drag and drop feature which will auto-generate codes for each component. Furthermore, it will be able to connect to any REST API, which will add a cloud database onto the application.  Equipment needed includes hardware such as computer and a smartphone. The computer will be used for designing and developing the application while the smartphone will be needed for trial runs of the application.  </p>
	 <p class="sectionContent"> Skills that are required for this project are knowing the basics of UX design, which can be done through observing the targeted users and taking on their perspective. It is very feasible to find the software required to design the application as Appery.io is an online platform that is accessible to anyone. Although it is a paid service, it is  guaranteed to ease the development process of this application. </p>	 
	 <p class="sectionContent">Upon the completion of the project, the problem of not knowing whether something belongs in general waste or mixed recycling bin will be solved. Users will be able to check whether their waste is recyclable very quickly and without any hassle. The application will positively impact the recycling industry in Australia by helping users correctly sort their waste, and the collection company who will have an easier time recycling waste that are actually meant to be recycled. </p>
